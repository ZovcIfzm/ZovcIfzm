My name is Alex Ruan, an incoming Masters student at the University of Michigan studying Computer Science.

- 🧑🏻‍ I'm a data science intern at KLA working on predictive analytics. I also work at Gallagher Lab integrating machine learning with automated wound area measurement.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to apply BERT towards solving non-NLP problems such as predicting differential inflammatory gene expression from histone modifications through from-scratch training.
